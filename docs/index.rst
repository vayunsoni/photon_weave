=============================================
Welcome to Photon Weave's Documentation!
=============================================

Photon Weave is a general-purpose quantum simulator framework that focuses on optical simulations in the Fock domain. The framework also includes a `CustomState` class, which can represent arbitrary quantum systems with a user-defined number of basis states. Photon Weave aims to be an easy-to-use simulator, abstracting away the complexities of product space management and operation applications for the user.

Mathematical Introduction
===========================

The **Photon Weave** framework is built around the representation and manipulation of optical states in various Hilbert spaces. The primary spaces used within the framework are the **Fock Space**, the **Polarization Space**, and a general **Custom Hilbert Space**.

Fock Space
-----------

The **Fock space** :math:`\mathcal{F}` is a Hilbert space that describes quantum state with discrete photon numbers. Each state in the Fock space is represented by a photon number basis :math:`|n\rangle`, where :math:`n=0,1,2,\ldots` denotes the number of photons. The Fock states are orthonormal and satifsy the following relation ship:

.. math::
   \langle n | m \rangle = \delta_{nm}

where :math:`\delta_{nm}` is the Kronecker delta. The Fock space is ideal for representing quantum light states, such as single-photon states, coherent states, and squeezed states.

In **Photon Weave**, a single Fock space can be represented in three different ways:
 - **Label**: Minimizes the memory required for representation, represented by a label (integer). Labels can represent any basis state such as :math:`|m\rangle`, where :math:`m \in \mathbb{N}`.
 - **State Vector**: Represents the state as a vector. This representation can describe any pure state, including global phases.
 - **Density Matrix**: Represents the state in a density matrix formalism. It can represent both pure and mixed states. Note that global phases are not preserved in this representation

Transition between the **Label**, **State Vector** and **Density Matrix** representations can be easily achieved using `expand()` or `contract()` methods. However, contractions may not always be successful if the state is not representable in the target form. For instance, contracting mixed state to a vector state will fail without raising an error. It is also important to node that contracting **Density matrix** to **State vector** also disregards the global phase.

Polarization Space
------------------

The **Polarization space** :math:`\mathcal{P}` describes the polarization state, usually of some Envelope. The polarization space is a two-dimensional Hilbert space :math:`\mathcal{H}^2`. With the following basis states:

.. math::
   \begin{align}
   |H\rangle &= \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} &
   |V\rangle &= \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix} &
   |R\rangle &= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{i}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix} &
   |L\rangle &= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \\ \frac{-i}{\sqrt{2}} \end{bmatrix}
   \end{align}


The **Polarization Space** can also be represented in three different forms:
 - **Label**: Minimizes the memory required for representation, represented by a `PolarizationLabel` enum class. Labels can represent the following states :math:`\{|H\rangle, |V\rangle, |R\rangle, |L\rangle\}`.
 - **State Vector**: Represents the state as a vector. This representation can describe any pure state, including global phases.
 - **Density Matrix**: Represents the state in a density matrix formalism. It can represent both pure and mixed states. Note that global phases are not preserved in this representation

Transition between the **Label**, **State Vector** and **Density Matrix** representations can be easily achieved using `expand()` or `contract()` methods. However, contractions may not always be successful if the state is not representable in the target form. For instance, contracting mixed state to a vector state will fail without raising an error. It is also important to node that contracting **Density matrix** to **State vector** also disregards the global phase.
 
Custom Hilbert Space
---------------------
The **Custom Hilbert Space** :math:`\mathcal{H}^d` can describe any arbitrary finite dimensional quantum system Hilbert space. When creating `CustomState(d)` the dimensionality of that space needs to be provided through :math:`d`.

The **Custom Hilbert Space** can also be represented in three different forms:
 - **Label**: Minimizes the memory required for representation, represented by an integer.
 - **State Vector**: Represents the state as a vector. This representation can describe any pure state, including global phases.
 - **Density Matrix**: Represents the state in a density matrix formalism. It can represent both pure and mixed states. Note that global phases are not preserved in this representation

Transition between the **Label**, **State Vector** and **Density Matrix** representations can be easily achieved using `expand()` or `contract()` methods. However, contractions may not always be successful if the state is not representable in the target form. For instance, contracting mixed state to a vector state will fail without raising an error. It is also important to node that contracting **Density matrix** to **State vector** also disregards the global phase.

Envelopes and Composite Envelopes
====================================
Since **Photon Weave** focuses on quantum optics, it defines an **Envelope**, which can be interpreted as a temporal mode or pulse. An Envelope is characterized by its central wavelength, temporal profile, Fock space and polarization space. The Fock and Polarization spaces define the photon number state and the polarization state, respectively. When the states are separate, they are contained within the individual Fock and Polarization instances. These states can be combined into a product space by using `combine()` method of the **Envelope** instance. When this method is invoked, the states are extracted from the Fock and Polarization instances, combined and stored in the `Envelope` instance. The Fock and Polarization instances hold references to the `Envelope` instance which contains their states.

The product state in an **Envelope** can be represented in a **State Vector** formalism or **Density Matrix** formalism. You can use `contract()` or `expand()` method on `Envelope` instance or any participating states to change between these representations.

When dealing with larger product states, such as two **Envelopes** or an **Envelope** and **Custom Hilbert State**, **Composite Envelopes** are used. **Composite Envelopes** offer a robust product space management system, where the product spaces are correctly maintained and dynamically created during the simulation. In short, when applying operations to the state in a **Composite Envelope** the product spaces are managed automatically to support any operation. Product spaces can only be created between state instances that share the same `CompositeEnvelope`. When state is represented in a `CompositeEnvelope` its state is extracted, and its instance then holds a reference to the `CompositeEnvelope` instance. Operations can then be applied to the state instance, envelope or composite envelope. **Photon Weave** will correctly route the operations to the appropriate level.

For example, if a Fock state instance is a part of an `Envelope`, which in turn is a part of `CompositeEnvelope`, but its space has not yet been extracted, you can apply operation that acts only on the said Fock space to any of the state containers (`CompostieEnvelope`, `Envelope`, `Fock`) and **Photon Weave** will then route the operation to the appropriate `Fock` instance.

This logic relieves the user from having to implement complex product space tracking and management, making simulations more straightforward and intuitive.

Applying Operations
=====================


**Photon Weave** ships with intuitive operation definition and application. All operations are defined through `Operation` class. First argument when defining the operation is the operation type. There are four operation types `Enum` classes defined:
- `FockOperationType`: `Enum` class defining operations on Fock spaces.
- `PolarizationOperationType`: `Enum` class defining operations on polarization spaces.
- `CustomStateOperationType`: `Enum` class defining operations on Custom State spaces.
- `CompositeOperationType`: `Enum` class defining operations on multiple spaces. This operation type can be applied to a product space with multiple spaces, where the spaces can be an arbitrary type.

Defining and applying operators is as straight forward as defining an operator and applying it to a space:

.. code:: python
    
    from photon_weave.operation import (
        Operation, FockOperationType,
        PolarizationOperationType,
        CustomStateOperaitonType,
        CompositeOperationType
    )

    fock = Fock()
    fock_op = Operation(FockOperationType.Displace, alpha=0.5)
    fock.apply_operation(fock_op)

    polarization = Polarization()
    polarization_op = Operation(PolarizationOperationType.RX, theta=0.5)
    polarization.apply_operation(polarization_op)

    custom_state = CustomState(3)

    custom_operator = jnp.array(
        [[0, 0, 0],
         [1, 0, 0],
    	 [0, 1, 0]]
    )
    custom_state_op= Operation(
        CustomStateOperation.Custom,
        operator = custom_operator
    )
    custom_state.apply_operation(custom_state_op)

    env=Envelope()
    # Envelope can extract the state into a product state
    env.combine()

    # Apply operation in an envelope
    env.apply_operation(fock_op, env.fock)
    env.apply_operation(polarization_op, env.polarization)
    # Or apply operation on individual spaces
    env.fock.apply_operation(fock_op)
    env.polarization.apply_operation(polarization_operation)


    ce = CompositeEnvelope(env, custom_state)
    # Composite Envelope can combine the states in any configuration
    ce.combine(env.fock, env.polarization, custom_state)

    # Operations can be applied at the state level
    env.fock.apply_operation(fock_operation)
    env.polarization.apply_operaiton(polarization_op)
    custom_state.apply_operation(custom_state_op)

    # Operations can be applied at the envelope level
    env.apply_operation(fock_op, env.fock)
    env.apply_operation(polarization_op, env.polarization)

    # Operations can also be applied at the composite operation level
    ce.apply_operation(fock_op, env.fock)
    ce.apply_operation(polarization_op, env.polarization)
    ce.apply_operation(custom_state_op, custom_state)

    # Additionally Composite operations can be applied only in
    # Composite envelope
    bs = Operation(
        CompositeOperaiton.NonPolarizingBeamSplitter,
	theta=jnp.pi/4
    )

    # Beam Split operation requires additional Fock space
    env2 = Envelope()

    # Add the new envelope to the composite envelope
    ce = CompositeEnvelope(ce, env2)

    ce.apply_operation(bs, env.fock, env2.fock)
    


Fock Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operations on Fock spaces are defined through `FockOperationType` class. `FockOperationType` will size the defined operator to the appropriate size before applying, so user doesn't need to explicitly control the dimensions. Furthermore in some cases, post operation state requires more dimensions in order to accurately represent the state. **Photon Weave** tries to compute number of dimensions needed to correctly represent the state. **Photon Weave** implements some of the common operations: (creation, annihilation, phase shift, squeezing, displacing and identity. Additionally the user can define an operator using an `Expression` or manually providing an operator with the `Custom` enumeration.

Fock operations can be applied on three levels, depending on the situation. If the fock state is in some product space, either in `Envelope` or in `CompositeEnvelope`, **Photon Weave** will correctly route the operation to the appropriate space.

To see the list of implemented operations on the consult the `fock_operation.py`.

Polarization Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operations on Polarization spaces are defined through `PolarizationOperationType` class. Since `Polarization` is always two dimensional Hilbert space, the operations need to be of same dimensions. Beside the implemented operators, Polarization operation also implements a `Custom` operation, but not `Expression` operation types.

To see the list of implemented operations and required parameters for each of them, consult `polarization_operation.py`.

Custom State Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Custom State Operations define operations which operate on `CustomState`. Custom state operations only defines two types of operations: `Custom` and `Expression`, requiring the user to explicitly define the operators either through expression or by providing the operator manually. Keep in mind that the dimensionality of the operator must match the dimensionality of the space, on which the operator will act.

Further documentation can be found at `custom_state_operation.py`.

Composite Operations 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Composite Operations define an operations on multiple spaces. Prior to operation the states must be members of the same composite envelope. These operations must be applied to the composite envelope and correct order of the spaces it acts on must be given. The order of operator tensoring must reflect the order of given spaces in the `apply_operation` method call.

Custom Operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Custom operation is a simple way of manually providing an operation. The user must make sure that the dimensionality of the operator matches the dimensionality of the target space. In case of `FockOperationType.Custom`, **Photon Weave** will resize the state to the dimensionality of the operator. If the operator has smaller dimension than the underlying state, the **Photon Weave** will try to shrink the state, but the shrinking process may fail if part of the state would fall outside of the new dimension cutoff.

.. code:: python
   
   operator = jnp.array(
	  [[0,0,0],
	   [1,0,0],
	   [0,1,0]]
    )
    op = Operation(CustomStateOperationType.Custom, operator=operator)



Expression defined operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some operations types offer `Expression` defined operators. When defining `Expression` type of operation, the user must give at least two key word arguments: `expr` and `context`.

`context` must be a dictionary, with keys of `str` type and values must be of a `Callable` type. Each callable must consume one argument. Each callable must compute a matrix operator, with dimensionality given as a parameter:

.. code:: python
   
    context = {
       "a_dag": lambda dims: creation_operator(dims[0])
       "a":     lambda dims: annihilation_operator(dims[0])
       "n":     lambda dims: number_operator(dims[0])
    }
    op = Operation(
	FockOperationType.Expresion,
	expr=("expm", ("s_mult", -1j, jnp.pi, "n")),
	context=context,
    )

In some cases the operation dimensions are not necessary (e.g. when operating on a fixed dimensional systems):

.. code:: python

    context = {
    "a": lambda dims: jnp.array([[0,0,0],[1,0,0],[0,0,0]]),
    "b": lambda dims: jnp.array([[0,0,0],[0,0,0],[0,1,0]])
    }
    expr = ("add", "a", "b")
    op = Operation(CustomStateOperationType.Expresion, expr=expr, context=context)

In those cases the `Callable` must still consume one dimension parameter, even if it doesn't use it.

The `expr` expression is then constructed in a Lisp inspired way with tuples. Tuples are evaluated from the inner most tuple to the outer most one. The first element in every single tuple is a string, which defines the operation. Following arguments are operands, on which the operation is evaluated. The operands can take value in any form (`Number`, `jnp.ndarray`, `Tuple` or `str`). If tuple is given, then this statement will be evaluated first and it's output will take the place of the tuple, and if `str` is given, it will be replaced by the value from given `context`.

To find out more and examples see `expression_interpreter.py`.

Applying Quantum Channels
=============================

Each of the states (`Fock`, `Polarization`, `CustomState` and `CompositeEnvelope`) allows an user to apply a Quantum Channel represented with Kraus operators. A quantum channel is a CPTP (Completely positive, trace preserving) map between two spaces and it can be defined with Kraus operators :math:`K_i`, where it must hold :math:`\sum_{k=0}^\infty K_i^\ast K_i \leq \mathbb{1}`. Any given channel is then applied:

.. math::
  \psi= \sum_i K_i \rho K_i^\ast


Note that in order to apply Kraus operator, the states needs to be in a density matrix formalism and it will be automatically expanded for you.


Measuring
===========

Measuring is as simple as calling the `measure()` method on any of the state containers (`Fock`, `Polarization`, `CustomState`, `Envelope` or `CompositeEnvelope`). Measuring `CustomState` is the most straight forward:

.. code:: python
   cs = CustomState(2)
   outcome = cs.measure()
   print(outcome[cs]) # prints: 0

`measures()` method returns a dictionary of outcomes, where key is the measured state and value is the measurement outcome of that state. Post measurement state then reflects the measured state. If state is in product space, than it is removed from the product state and stored in the original container in *Label* form.


When measuring `Fock` or `Polarization` by default you measure the whole envelope, if the states were part of any envelope. Measuring by default is also *destructive*, which destroys the state and any operations post measurements are impossible. Thus measuring the `Fock` or `Polarization`, which is a part of an `Envelope` will also measure the other member of the `Envelope` and `measure()` call will return a dictionary of outcomes containing both outcomes. If you want to *separately* measure one of these states, you could invoke `measure(separate_measurement=True)`. If you need to measure non-destructively you can invoke measurement call with `measure(destructive=False)`. This will measure the state and the state will be retained, but still affected by the measurement process.

The states can be measured in an envelope, by defining which state should be measured and optionally setting the `separate_measurement` and `destructive` key word arguments after specifying the state that should be measured:

.. code:: python
    env1 = Envelope()
    outcome = env1.measure(env1.fock, separate_measurement=True)
    # will return only measurement outcome for the Fock space

    env1 = Envelope()
    env2 = Envelope()
    ce = CompositeEnvelope(env1, env2)

    outcome = ce.measure(env1.fock, env2.fock, destructive=False)
    # Will measure both fock and polarization states and return outcomes
    # Since it is not a destructive measurement, the post-measurement states
    # will be contained in respective Fock and Polarization instances


Measuring with POVM Operators
=================================

**Photon Weave** also allows for measuring the states with POVM operators. POVM measurement is invoked by calling `measure_POVM()` method call of any of the state containers (`Fock`, `Polarization`, `CustomState`, `Envelope`, `CompositeEnvelope`). When measuring in `Fock`, `Polarization` or `CustomState`, only operators need be provided. When measuring in `Envelope` or `CompositeEnvelope` also measured states need to be provided. When providing the states order is important and should reflect the tensoring order in the operator.

Mathematically, a POVM is a set of positive semi-definite operators :math:\{E_i\} that sum up to the identity operator, i.e.,

.. math:: \sum_i E_i = \mathbb{1}.

When measuring a quantum state :math:\rho with a POVM :math:\{E_i\}, the probability of obtaining the outcome :math:i is given by:

.. math:: p(i) = \mathrm{Tr}(E_i \rho).

The state after measurement, conditioned on the outcome :math:i, becomes:

.. math:: \rho_i = \frac{E_i \rho E_i^\dagger}{\mathrm{Tr}(E_i \rho)}.

The `measure_POVM()` method will return tuple with the outcome as the first value and outcomes dictionary as the second value. If for example you measure part of an envelope with POVM operators, you will receive measurement outcome for the other part in a dictionary. You can choose to measure non-destructively with `destructive=False` keyword argument, where all of the measurements will be performed non-destructively.

.. code:: python

    env = Envelope()
    operators = [jnp.array([[1, 0], [0, 0]]), jnp.array([[0, 0], [0, 1]])]
    m = env.measure_POVM(operators, env.polarization)


Reproducability
===============

For Reproducability **Photon Weave** allows the user to set the seed that is used with random processes. The seed is configured though `Config` class. `Config` class is a singleton class and is consulted at every random process.

.. code:: python
    from photon_weave.photon_weave import Config

    C = Config()
    C.set_seed(1)
