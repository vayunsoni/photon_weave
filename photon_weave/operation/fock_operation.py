    FockOperationType

    Constructs an operator, which acts on a single Fock space.

    Creation
    --------
    Constructs a creation operator :math:`\hat a^\dagger`
    Application to a fock state results in
    :math:`\hat a^\dagger |n\rangle = \sqrt{n+1}|n+1\rangle`
    The operator however normalizes the state afterwards, to when using
    Creation operator the resulting state is:
    :math:`\hat a^\dagger |n\rangle = |n+1\rangle`
    The dimensions of the Fock space is changed to the highest number state
    with non zero amplitude plus two.

    Annihilation
    ------------
    Constructs an annihlation operator :math:`\hat a`
    Application to a fock state results in
    :math:`\hat a|n\rangle = \sqrt{n}|n-1\rangle`
    The operator however normalizes the state afterwards, to when using
    Creation operator the resulting state is:
    :math:`\hat a|n\rangle = |n-1\rangle`
    The dimensions of the Fock space is changed to the highest number
    state with non zero amplitude plust two.

    PhaseShift
    ----------
    Constructs a phase shift operator :math:`\hat U(\phi)=e^{-i\phi\hat n}`
    The operation of this operator on a matrix state acts as a identity,
    since global shift is not representable in the density matrix.
    The dimension of the Fock space remains unchanged.

    Squeeze
    -------
    Constructs a Squeezing operator
    :math:`\hat S(\zeta)=e^{\frac{1}{2}(z^*\hat a^2 - z \hat a^\dagger^2)}`
    The dimensions of the Fock space required to accurately represent the application
    of this operator is iteratively determined, resulting in appropriate dimension.

    Displace
    --------
    Constructs a Squeezing operator
    :math:`\hat D(\alpha)=e^{\alpha \hat a^\dagger - \alpha^* \hat a}`
    The dimensions of the Fock space required to accurately represent the application
    of this operator is iteratively determined, resulting in appropriate dimension.
    The dimensions of the Fock space required to accurately represent the application
    of this operator is iteratively determined, resulting in appropriate dimension.

    Identity
    --------
    Constructs a Squeezing operator :math:`\hat I`
    This operator has no effect on the quantum state. The dimensions remain unchanged.

    Custom
    ------
    Constructs a custom operator, which means the operator needs to be manually
    provided, one must pay attention to the fact that operators dimensions need to match
    the dimensions of the Fock space. If the operator is larger than the underlying
    fock space, then the dimensions of the respective Fock space will increase to match
    the provided operator. Otherwise the state will be shrunk. If shrinking is not
    succesfull then the operation will fail. Shinking is not succesfull if part of the
    state is removed by the process of shrinking.

    Usage Example:
    >>> operator = jnp.ndarray(
    >>>    [[0,0],
    >>>     [0,1]]
    >>> )
    >>> op = Operation(FockOperationType.Custom, operator=operator)

    Expression
    ---------
    Constucts an operator based on the expression provided. Alongside expression
    also list of state types needs to be provided together with the context.
    Context needs to be a dictionary of operators, where the keys are strings used in
    the expression and values are lambda functions, expecting one argument: dimensions.

    An example of context and operator usage
    >>> context = {
    >>>    "a_dag": lambda dims: creation_operator(dims[0])
    >>>    "a":     lambda dims: annihilation_operator(dims[0])
    >>>    "n":     lambda dims: number_operator(dims[0])
    >>> }
    >>> op = Operation(FockOperationType.Expression,
    >>>                expr=("expm"("s_mult", 1j,jnp.pi, "a"))),
    >>>                state_types=(Fock,), # Is applied to only one fock space
    >>>                context=context)
    >>> fock.apply_operation(op)
